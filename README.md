**This Python script is a simple yet powerful way to fetch real-time weather data and turn it into beautiful visualizations. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to pull weather forecasts for a chosen city (New Delhi) and then plots temperature, humidity, and wind speed trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The script runs smoothly in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and is perfect for anyone looking to explore API integration and data visualization.
Whether you're a student, a data enthusiast, or just someone curious about the weather, this project makes it easy to track changes and spot patterns. It’s useful for weather monitoring, research, and even building interactive dashboards with tools like Streamlit or Flask. The best part? It’s simple, effective, and a great way to level up your Python skills. So go ahead, give it a try, and turn raw weather data into meaningful insights! **
